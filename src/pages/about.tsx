                In 2019, ink! started out as a small project at Parity Technologies (the company that stewarded
                Polkadot). Over the years, ink! grew into a sophisticated ecosystem and a community did form around it.
                Throughout all this time Parity continued to allocate developer resources to the project, which is
                amazing!
              </p>
              <p>
                In April 2024, ink! moved out of the Parity umbrella. Instead of one company, it is nowadays developed
                and maintained by an alliance of individual developers, companies, and community teams altogether. You
                can read more on our transition out of Parity here.
              </p>
              <p>
                We continue to work closely with Parity, we contribute code to Parity-maintained components and
                regularly synchronize with Parity developers. Parity continues to be involved in ink! as well: in late
                2024 SRLabs and the Parity security team conducted an audit of ink! v5 (read more here).

                The ink! Alliance holds bi-weekly meetings about the continued development and direction of ink!. That
                concerns all product aspects, from core development to for example putting out a public call for redoing
                our old and clunky website to the shiny new thing you are currently surfing (see here for more info).
              </p>
              <p>We record our meeting notes in this repository.</p>
              <p>
                The Alliance also created a Use Ink Ltd. in the UK to which all licenses and intellectual property was
                transferred.
              </p>
              <p>
                The largest part of our funding comes from the Polkadot treasury. We are very happy about this continued
                support! The treasury proposals are all open and transparent, our last big one was this one.
              </p>
              <p>
                The funding got transferred to this multisig, which is controlled by six curators with a threshold of
                4/6 approvals.
