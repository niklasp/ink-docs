# Pre-compile

We don't have any examples for this functionality yet. 
Our intention add one here, once the pre-compile API in `pallet-revive`
is clearer.

The idea here is to implement a pre-compile that outputs log information
to the node process console (`stdout` or `stderr`).

This pre-compile could then be called from within an ink! contract.
