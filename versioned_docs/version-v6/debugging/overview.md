# Overview

On a high-level there are two workflows for debugging your contract:

* You can write tests using one of the mechanisms described on the
  [Contract Testing](./overview.md) page.
* You can interact with your contract via a UI or command-line. The  
  workflow is described on the [Call Your Contract](../getting-started/calling.md) page.

In each of those two options you have access to more detailed debugging
information. We explain how to utilize this info on this page.

## Emit debugging events

When building a contract without the `--release` flag,
`cargo-contract` automatically enables the feature `ink/ink-debug`.

You can utilize this to emit debugging events in your contract:

```rust
#[cfg(feature = "ink-debug")]
use ink::prelude::string::String;

#[cfg(feature = "ink-debug")]
#[ink::event]
pub struct DebugEvent {
    message: String,
}

#[ink::message]
fn insert(&mut self) {
    #[cfg(feature = "ink-debug")]
    self.env().emit(DebugEvent {
        message: format!("received {:?}", self.env().transferred_value());
    });
    // â€¦
}
```

This event will be shown when you call a contract. You can also access it in E2E tests.

## Return an error message
Return a specific error message via `ink::return_value(REVERT, err);` 
and do a dry-run of the contract call. The result of the dry-run will 
then present this data.

```rust
#[ink::message]
fn insert(&self) {
    #[cfg(feature = "ink-debug")]
    ink::return_value(
        ink::env::ReturnFlags::REVERT,
        format!("received {:?}", self.env().transferred_value()).as_bytes();
    );
}
```

:::note
TODO add example code for E2E test + `cargo-contract`
:::

:::note
This output is not printed if you execute a transaction on-chain!
The transaction will just fail with `ExtrinsicFailed`.

It is only printed for RPC calls, so for dry-runs.
In the E2E tests you have to execute `.dry_run()` to get
this information.

## Tracing APIs
The `pallet-revive` has implemented a tracing API. 
This is what the Ethereum-debugging tools use when interacting with `pallet-revive`.

## Sandbox API
Use the sandbox API `#[ink_e2e::test(backend(runtime_only))]`. Debugging here 
could be done via [DRink!](https://github.com/use-ink/drink).

## Pre-compile
- Implement a pre-compile that can be called from a contract to output log info (they said Hardhat does something like this).

## Decode Data Payload

You can use a block explorer or an app like PolkadotJs to retrieve the data payload of a contract transaction, and then use [cargo-contract](https://github.com/use-ink/cargo-contract) to decode it.

```bash
# From your contract directory
$ cargo contract decode message -d fe5bd8ea01000000
```

This command will output the method name and parameters encoded in the data payload:

```
Decoded data: inc_by { n: 1 }
```

If the contract was called through a cross-contract interaction, the payload will not be available in the transaction. In such cases, you can use the approach described in the next section to access it.

## Replay and Debug a Block

:::caution
This section has not yet been updated to ink! v6.

TODO Verify if this still works.
:::

To replay a transaction, you can use [Chopstick](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/chopsticks) to create a local fork of the chain and replay the block with trace-level logging.

Assuming you have a node that you can connect to at `$ENDPOINT` and the transaction you want to replay is in block `$BLOCK_HASH`, you can use the following command:

```bash
$ npx @acala-network/chopsticks@latest run-block \
    --endpoint $ENDPOINT \
    --block $BLOCK_HASH \
    --runtime-log-level 5 \
    | grep runtime::contracts
```

This command replays the block with trace-level logging enabled. By filtering the output with `runtime::contracts`, you can view all the contract calls in the block:

```
runtime::contracts           TRACE: call ExportedFunction::Call account: , input_data: [246, 118, 44, 201]
runtime::contracts           TRACE: call ExportedFunction::Call account: , input_data: [254, 91, 216, 234, 1, 0, 0, 0]
runtime::contracts           TRACE: call result ExecReturnValue { flags: (empty), data: [0] }
runtime::contracts           TRACE: call result ExecReturnValue { flags: (empty), data: [0] }
```

From here, you can identify the call you are interested in and decode the data payload:

```bash
$ echo 254, 91, 216, 234, 1, 0, 0, 0 \
    | tr ',' ' ' \
    | xargs printf '%02x' \
    | xargs cargo contract decode message -d
```

This command will output the following:

```
Decoded data: inc_by { n: 1 }
```

## Fork Node and Replay Transactions

:::caution
This section has not yet been updated to ink! v6.

TODO Verify if this still works.
:::

You can also use [Chopstick](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/chopsticks) to start a local fork of your chain.

This command starts a fork beginning at block `$BLOCK_HASH`. You can connect to this fork using `ws://localhost:8000` to submit extrinsics via PolkadotJs or `cargo contract`:

```bash
$ npx @acala-network/chopsticks@latest \
    --endpoint $ENDPOINT \
    --block $BLOCK_HASH \
    --runtime-log-level 5
```

Here, for example, you can re-run the transaction that we decoded in the previous section:

```bash
$ cargo contract call \
    --contract $CONTRACT_ADDR \
    --message inc_by --args 1 \
    --suri //Alice \
    --url ws://localhost:8000
```

Since trace-level logging is used, you will receive detailed information about all the host functions called during the execution of the contract:

```
runtime::contracts           TRACE: call ExportedFunction::Call account: , input_data: [254, 91, 216, 234, 2, 0, 0, 0]
runtime::contracts           TRACE: call result ExecReturnValue { flags: (empty), data: [0] }
runtime::contracts           DEBUG: Execution finished with debug buffer: seal0::value_transferred(out_ptr: 65488, out_len_ptr: 65516) = Ok(())
seal0::input(out_ptr: 65536, out_len_ptr: 65524) = Ok(())
seal1::get_storage(key_ptr: 65536, key_len: 4, out_ptr: 65540, out_len_ptr: 65524) = Ok(Success)
seal2::set_storage(key_ptr: 65536, key_len: 4, value_ptr: 65540, value_len: 4) = Ok(4)
seal0::seal_return(flags: 0, data_ptr: 65536, data_len: 1) = Err(TrapReason::Return(ReturnData { flags: 0, data: [0] }))
```
