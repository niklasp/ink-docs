# Solidity & MetaMask Compatibility

:::caution
This page has not yet been written for ink! v6.

TODO @davidsemakula
:::

With ink! v6, we have introduced a new attribute `abi` for the `#[ink::contract]` macro.
It allows building your contract in Solidity-compatibility mode ([more details here](../macros-attributes/contract).

The implication of supporting Solidity ABI encoding is that there is a restriction on
the types you can use as constructor/message arguments or return types.
You won't be able to use Rust types for which no mapping to a Solidity type exists.
An error about a missing trait implementation for this type will be thrown.

Please note that your contract sizes will get larger if you support both the ink!
and Solidity ABI.
